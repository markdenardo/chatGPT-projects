compose 10 haiku using the designated groups of animals, in the theme of zen koans

Group 1: Birds

A bird on the branch
Sings a song of emptiness
Silence fills the air.

The sparrow chirps loud
Breaking the stillness of dawn
The master listens.

Wings spread in the sky
Free as the wind, no limits
The eagle soars high.

A flock of geese fly
In perfect V-formation
Unity in flight.

The owl hoots at night
Wisdom in its piercing eyes
A teacher in dark.

Group 2: Insects

The butterfly rests
On a flower, fleeting beauty
Momentary joy.

The ant carries on
Through obstacles and challenges
Persistence pays off.

A spider weaves silk
Masterfully creating webs
Patience and skill shown.

The firefly glows bright
In the darkness, a beacon
Lighting the way home.

A bee gathers nectar
From flower to flower it goes
Purposeful and calm.

Group 3: Marine Creatures

The waves crash and roar
The dolphin leaps through the surf
Eternal movement.

The octopus hides
In the coral, a master
Of camouflage art.

The sea turtle swims
Through currents and tides it goes
Steady and serene.

The jellyfish floats
Drifting through the ocean blue
A lesson in stillness.

The shark glides through depths
Silent and deadly it hunts
An apex predator.
